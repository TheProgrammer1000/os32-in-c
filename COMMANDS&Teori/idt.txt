int21h:
  pushad
  cli
  call int21_handler
  sti
  popad
  iret

we need to clear the interrupt with cli
and continue the interrupt with sti

so we then pushad so all the registers and segment
get push to the stack, then we clear the interrupt with
cli then calling int21_handler

then we sti so continue with the interrupt and pop all the
registers and segment back again then we do iret which mean
interrupt return!
